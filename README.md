# Encrypted-Group-Chat-Application-with-added-Cipher-Texting
This a project built completely in basic Java. It basically develops a group chat application that displays messages in Baconian Cipher onto the screen. This helps in countering breach of system security, i.e., if someone hacks into a person's system. The deciphered messages are stored in a remote file. The user can read received messages from this file and then answer accordingly. All this process is encrypted as well, in order to counter breach of network security.
